!THIS IS NOT A FULL AUTOMATION. IT IS JUST TO REDUCE AMOUNT OF MANULA CLICKS FOR DEVELOPERS WHEN THEY ARE WORKING ON LOCAL ENVIRONMENTS!

The Automation is implemented using the playwright. https://playwright.dev/

Note: make sure you do not commit any credentials to the repo

Some useful commands:

```bash
$ npx playwright test  --headed --project=chromium
```
