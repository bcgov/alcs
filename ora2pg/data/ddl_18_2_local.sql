COMMENT ON TABLE oats_issues IS E'An INQUIRY is a specific type of ISSUE, where someone poses a question to the Commission in regards to land use and the ALR.  The Commission will reference this information if there is an ALR APPLICATION or COMPLAINT within the vicinity.  A COMPLAINT is a specific type of ISSUE that warrants further investigation and may lead to an enforcement action.  If further enforcement action is warranted, the typical course is:  1. Issue a Stop Work Order (SWO).  The property owner may request this order be reviewed with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  2. The ALC staff will make recommendations to the CEO as to whether further enforcement action should be applied, in the form of fines and/or land remediation.  3. The CEO may then impose a fine and/or land remediation.  An ISSUE is either an INQUIRY or COMPLAINT regarding land use within the jurisdiction of the ALR.';

COMMENT ON TABLE oats_subdiv_parcel_intents IS E'A SUBDIV PARCEL INTENT is either a parcel an applicant wishes to create as part of an ALR APPL COMPONENT-NON BOUNDARY CHANGE-SUBDIVISION, or a parcel the Commission has decided could be created.  This depends on whether ALR APPL COMPONENT is a proposal component (the relationship from ALR APPLICATION is supplied) or a decision component (the relationship from ALR APPL DECISION is supplied).   For each ALR APPL COMPONENT-NON BOUNDARY CHANGE-SUBDIVISION there must be at least two or more SUBDIV PARCEL INTENTS.  I.E. the creation of one new parcel always results in two parcels being created, the new parcel and the remainder of the original.The total of SUBDIV PARCEL INTENT . PARCEL SIZE should be the same as the parent ALR APPL COMPONENT''s AREA.  A decision SUBDIV PARCEL INTENT is considered to be actualized when a relationship from a SUBDIV DESIGN PARCEL has been established.  Note: Two or more SUBDIV PARCEL INTENTS may be actualized by a single SUBDIV DESIGN PARCEL.  For example:  The decision allows the creation of 4 x 10ha parcels.  The applicant submits a survey plan that only creates 2x20ha parcels.  The actualization of two of the 10ha parcels will be from one of the 20ha parcels, and the actualization of the other two 10ha parcels will be from the other 20ha parcel.    Another example:  The decision allows the creation of 2 x 20ha parcels on the northern half of the property and 4 x 10ha lots on the southern half of the property.  The applicant submits a survey plan that creates the 2 northern 20ha parcels, but does not explicitly include the southern half of the property.  The actualization of the two 20ha parcels will be from the survey plan''s two 20ha parcels.  If the applicant does not submit another survey plan before the decision expires, the southern four 10ha lots will be actualized by a by 40ha remainder SUBDIV DESIGN PARCEL (REMAINDER IND = ''Y'').';
