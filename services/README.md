# gRPC

Server communication between ALCS server and Portal server is performed using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). gRPC uses protocol buffers (\*.proto) as both its Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying message interchange format.

ALCS and Portal support mutual TLS to ensure secure communication. TLS also enabled for local environment using the self-signed certificates included in the source code. If you need to generate new set of certificates or learn more about the process refer to [certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap)

TS implementation of \*.proto files can be provided manually or generated using [ts-proto](https://github.com/stephenh/ts-proto/blob/main/NESTJS.markdown) tool
